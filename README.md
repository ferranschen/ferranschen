## About Me 👋

Hello! I'm Wei-Hao Chen, a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science at Purdue University and a member of the **Human-Centered Software Systems Lab** under the guidance of Professor Tianyi Zhang.

My research focuses on technical aspects of **Human Computer/AI Interaction (HCI/HAI)**, particularly in building novel interactive systems to help:

- 📊 Data scientists
- 💻 Developers
- 👥 End-users

I leverage techniques such as **Large Language Models (LLM)**, **Artificial Intelligence**, and **Programming-by-Demonstration** to create AI-powered tools with strong UI/UX and human-centered design. Most of my projects are system-centric, aiming to improve efficiency and usability within data science pipelines.
